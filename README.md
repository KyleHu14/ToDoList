# ToDoList
 
I followed a tutorial from a channel called Codemy for the designer .py file of this project. All credits go to Codemy.<br> This ToDoList serves as a way to teach myself how to use PyQt5. I will update the credit individuals / videos that I referenced as I learn how to make the ToDoList from scratch. <br>
